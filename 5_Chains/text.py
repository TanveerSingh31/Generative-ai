What is LangChain?
LangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep-learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate responses to user queries—for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based prompts. LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the customization, accuracy, and relevancy of the information the models generate. For example, developers can use LangChain components to build new prompt chains or customize existing templates. LangChain also includes components that allow LLMs to access new data sets without retraining.

Why is LangChain important?
LLMs excel at responding to prompts in a general context, but struggle in a specific domain they were never trained on. Prompts are queries people use to seek responses from an LLM. For example, an LLM can provide an answer to how much a computer costs by providing an estimate. However, it can't list the price of a specific computer model that your company sells. 

To do that, machine learning engineers must integrate the LLM with the organization’s internal data sources and apply prompt engineering—a practice where a data scientist refines inputs to a generative model with a specific structure and context. 

LangChain streamlines intermediate steps to develop such data-responsive applications, making prompt engineering more efficient. It is designed to develop diverse applications powered by language models more effortlessly, including chatbots, question-answering, content generation, summarizers, and more.
